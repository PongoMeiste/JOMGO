                Welcome to JOMGO! We’re Jake, Joseph, and Mason, three friends who came together to create a fun
                collection of clicker games. Our goal is simple: to bring you engaging, easy-to-play games that you can
                enjoy in your free time. Each game is designed to offer a unique experience that will keep you hooked
                for hours. At JOMGO, we’ve developed three exciting games: The first is
                Waxed Lightly Weathered Cut Copper Stairs, where you click
                your way through levels while collecting items and unlocking new
                features, all centered around the unique theme of weathered copper stairs. Next, we have Car Clicker, a
                game for car enthusiasts. Click to earn money, buy new cars, and expand your collection. It’s a game
                where every click brings you closer to creating the ultimate car empire. Lastly, we’ve got Dirt Clicker,
                a simple yet addictive game where you gather dirt and upgrade your tools to expand your dirt empire.
                It’s all about progress with every click! We built JOMGO to share our love of gaming with others, and we
                hope our clicker games give you a fun way to pass the time.
